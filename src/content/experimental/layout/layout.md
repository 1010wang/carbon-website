<page-intro>IBM 2x Grid is a guide and fundamental for designing across devices and mediums. It provides a structural, proportional, and spatial system in every experience we create. </page-intro>

## Fixed 'Mini Unit' Grid
Mini unit is the basic of the 2x Grid. It is the fundamental and the guide of every component. All mini units are 8 pixel by 8 pixel. Paddings, gutters, margins, spacers, and the dimensions of shapes are determined by mini units.

## Fluid 2x Grid
### Columns
Column structure is important for layouts. The primary layout choices for designs are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 columns. Maintaining column structure is vital to achieving a well crafted duo experience.

### Margins
Margins are fixed while the columns are fluid. They are available above medium size of the screens. Margin values are set to breakpoints. 24px margin for Max; 16px margin for Xlarge, Large and Medium; 0px margin for Small.

### Padding
Paddings are set to breakpoints. Paddings are fixed to 16 pixels while columns are fluid. Always align type to against the padding and organize content with discipline and rigor. 

### Gutters
Within the 2x Grid, a wide gutter is avaiable to support the need of layout design. Gutters help to build layouts with space between containers, such as dashboards, cards, etc.
