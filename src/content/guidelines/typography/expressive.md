## IBM Expressive Theme

The IBM Editorial type theme introduces the new IBM Design Language tokens. Please switch to the new tokens wherever possible. Legacy type tokens will be updated to the v19a type scale and should be used for maintenance purposes only.

Type tokens are simply pre-set configurations of typographic elements (font-size, weight, line-height, etc) that are specifically calibrated for use in IBM Editorial design. Selecting the appropriate type style is determined by layout or template structure. Layouts may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies.

## Expressive type sets

Even though IBM Plex contains a wide range of scales, it’s important to use acurated type sets. For a clear and focused reading experience, we've created specific sets for IBM editorial experiences.

### Fluid Type

To create a better experience along with our fluid grid, fluid type is an option for large headers and display type. We set up our fixed type scales for the breakpoints and have them being fluid in between. This helps us to maintain the quality of typography.

#### Headers and Displays

Fluid type is applied to large headline and display type styles. We set up fixed type scales at the breakpoints and are fluid in between. This helps us to maintain the quality of typography. Display types (“j” and “k”) are reserved only for graphic/visual elements. These should be used sparingly and thoughtfully within a user journey. It is not suitable for complex messaging, does not need to appear on every page and should never be used as headlines. 

Fluid type is only meant to be used in Editorial layouts. Please do not use it Product UI.
