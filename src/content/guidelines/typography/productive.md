## IBM Productive Theme

The IBM Product type theme introduces the new IBM Design Language tokens. Please switch to the new tokens wherever possible. Legacy type tokens will be updated to the v19a type scale and should be used for maintenance purposes only.

Type tokens are simply pre-set configurations of typographic elements (font-size, weight, line-height, etc) that are specifically calibrated for use in IBM product design. Selecting the appropriate type style is determined by layout or template structure. Products may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies.

## Productive Type Sets

Even though IBM Plex contains a wide range of scales, itâ€™s important to use a curated type set. For a clear and focused reading experience, consider content needs and how type works across various screen sizes.

#### Supporting styles
<type-spec 
    token="code-01" 
    type="IBM Plex Mono" 
    size="12px / .75rem" 
    weight="400 / Regular" 
    letter_spacing=".32px" 
    line-height="1">
This is for inline code snippets and smaller code elements.
</type-spec>
