## About patterns

In Carbon, _patterns_ comprise common user flows and scenarios which are too complex or too universal to be encapsulated in a single component. Individual patterns often include two or more components from the system or apply to multiple components independently.

The patterns library is constantly growing, and the Carbon team encourages contributions of UX patterns which can apply to a broad set of Carbon users.
