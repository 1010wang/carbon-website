## Overview

The Carbon Design Kit contains core visual styles, components, color swatches, iconography, and templates. It also has a collection of symbols and text styles for rapid design and layout prototyping. Each is designated its own page, which may be accessed via the left side panel.

The Design Kit is available through GitHub and internally to IBMers through Box Drive. The kti can be used as a normal file in the Sketch application or you can load the file as a Sketch Library source.

### Why Sketch?

<a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target=blank>Sketch</a> is the industry standard design tool for UI design.

You can purchase a license for $99/year. If you donʼt have a license for Sketch, you may sign up for a 30-day free trial. Sketch is easy to learn, and they offer many [tutorials](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/helpful-guide-to-getting-started-with-sketch-ecab4b5738bb) for further learning.

### Releases

The Carbon Design System team often makes improvements to the Design Kit. We track all release updates in our <a href="https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/releases" target=blank>change log</a>, so check back frequently!

4. Get the updates
	- To update to the latest Carbon library version you will have to download the newest version of the Carbon Design Kit each time it is released and replace the previous version.
	- Follow the specific [instructions](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-design-kit/wiki/Sketch-Libraries-Overview) on the wiki to ensure a smooth transition.

## Use with Box Drive

*For IBM internal users only.* Open source users should use the download from GitHub method. Using the kit through Box Drive enables automatic updates to your Carbon Design Kit library without having to manually reload down the kit everytime as in the download from GitHub method.

1. Follow the instructions on [IBM Digital Design](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/design-kit/) to get the IBM Design kit through Box Drive.
- Once you have installed and gained access to the `IBM Design kit`, navigate to the `product design` folder. Select the version of Carbon you'd like to use to find the `Carbon Design Kit` file.
- When updates are available to the kit library a purple `Library Update` badge will appear in the top right corner of your Sketch file.
	-  Click `Library Updates Available` then `Accept updates` in the modal.
