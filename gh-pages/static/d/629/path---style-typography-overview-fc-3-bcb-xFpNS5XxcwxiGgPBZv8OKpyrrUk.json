Font weight and size pairings must be carefully balanced. A bold weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight font of the same size. However, a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically higher than a bold font if the lighter weight type size is significantly larger than the bold.\n\nIBM Plex family provides a wide range of weights. However, only SemiBold, Regular, Light should be used for product design.\n\n|  |  |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Font-weight: 300 / Light <br> _Should only be used at sizes greater than or equal to 18px / 1.125rem_  | Light 300  |\n| Font-weight: 400 / Normal | Normal 400 |\n| Font-weight: 600 / Semi-bold   | Semi-bold 600   |\n\n### Body copy\n\nWe recommend using two sizes for body copy. The first is UI specific. To maximize screen real estate we chose a smaller 14px / 0.875rem body copy size for the standard UI console. However, for areas that have prolonged reading, like Documentation, we use a larger body copy size of 16px / 1rem to enhance readability.\n\n|Body copy         | px   | rem     |\n|------------------|-----|--------|\n|Standard UI       |14px |0.875rem|\n|Prolonged reading |16px |1rem    |\n\n### Line-height\n\nLine-height, traditionally known as leading, is one of several factors that directly contribute to readability and pacing of copy. Line-heights are based on the size of the font itself. Ideal line-heights for standard copy have a ratio of 1:1.5 (typesize : line-height). For example, a type at 16px/1rem would have a line-height of 1.5rem/24px (16 x 1.5). The exception to this rule are headings, which need less spacing and therefore have a line-height ratio of 1:1.25.\n\n|Line-height       |Ratio  |\n|------------------|-------|\n|Standard UI       |1:1.5  |\n|Headers           |1:1.25 |\n\n\n### Line-length\n\nLine-length, traditionally known as measure, is the number of characters in a single line. It also directly contributes to the readability and pacing of copy. Lines that are too long degrade eye tracking from line to line, making it difficult to gauge which line to read next. In contrast, lines that are too short make it difficult for a reader to maintain a steady reading rhythm. Short lines often create disproportionate ragged edges that negatively affect the design.\n\n**Line-length: 52 - 78 characters**\n"}]}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/style/typography/overview","currentPage":"overview"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Typography","label":"Style","tabs":["Overview","Type Styles"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/style/typography/overview","currentPage":"overview"}}
